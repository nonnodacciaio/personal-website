			"p1": "Hey there! I'm Marco Sabau, a Software Developer who loves building awesome web applications. I may not have a fancy degree in computer science, but I did study International Relationships for Marketing in high school. And to supercharge my coding skills, I completed a kickass 3-month Java bootcamp at Generation Italy.",
			"p2": "I've been in the game for a little while now. In 2022, I spent a cool 2 months at Omis Spa as a Developer, honing my craft. Currently, I'm rockin' it at Famas System since November 2022, where I get to flex my coding muscles every day.",
			"p3": "My main jam is Angular and C#—those are my go-to weapons for web development. But let me tell you, I'm not limited to just that. I dabble in other popular languages for my personal projects, keeping things fresh and exciting.",
			"p4": "You know, my philosophy when it comes to coding is all about making things legible, maintainable, and scalable. Clean code is where it's at! It not only looks good, but it also makes life easier for everyone involved.",
			"p5": "When I'm not slinging code, you'll find me working on personal projects that let me explore new ideas and push my boundaries. Oh, and I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie too—I love riding my mountain bike and feeling the wind in my face. And let's not forget my musical side! I enjoy strumming on my guitar and bass, adding some rhythm and melody to my life.",
			"p6": "So, that's me in a nutshell—a passionate Software Developer with a knack for web development, a love for clean code, and a penchant for adventure. I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to grow and learn while creating amazing solutions. Let's connect and make something awesome together!"
